## System Architecture

### Design and UI/UX
- **Aesthetic**: Modern purple/blue gradient theme with the new HomeBase logo featuring a house-shaped design with blue gradient "H" on purple background. Clean, professional appearance optimized for homeowner experience.
- **Components**: Utilizes shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives for a consistent and sophisticated look.
- **Theming**: Supports light/dark mode with purple-based color palette (primary: hsl(260, 65%, 55%)) for homeowner interface, maintaining red theme for contractor interface.
- **Navigation**: Role-based dashboards (Homeowner and Contractor) serve as primary interfaces, offering tailored content and quick actions.
- **Logo**: Updated to use custom HomeBase logo with house icon and gradient blue "H" design, imported from attached assets.

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Vite is used for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, written in TypeScript with ES modules. Implements a RESTful API with JSON responses.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, integrated with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations and Drizzle Kit for schema management.
- **Data Flow**: Client requests use TanStack Query, Express routes handle processing, data access is via Drizzle ORM to PostgreSQL, and responses are JSON. Shared TypeScript types ensure end-to-end type safety.
