## Database Protection & Migrations

### Safe Schema Changes (Migrations)
The project uses Drizzle ORM with a migration system to protect user data during schema updates:

1. **Generate migrations** (after changing `shared/schema.ts`):
   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit generate
   ```
   This creates incremental SQL files in `./migrations/` without touching the database.

2. **Apply migrations** (production-safe):
   ```bash
   npx tsx server/migrate.ts
   ```
   This applies pending migrations incrementally, preserving all existing data.

3. **Development sync** (use with caution):
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
   This is faster but less safe - only use in development when you're sure no data will be lost.

### Database Backups
The backup utility exports all important tables to JSON files:

1. **Create a backup**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx server/backup.ts
   ```
   Creates `backups/backup-{timestamp}.json` with all user data.

2. **List available backups**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx server/backup.ts list
   ```

### Best Practices
- **Always generate migrations** before making schema changes in production
- **Create backups** before major updates or schema changes
- **Never change ID column types** (serial ↔ varchar) as this breaks existing data
- **Test migrations** in development before applying to production

## SOC 2 Security Compliance (December 2025)

### Security Infrastructure
HomeBase implements comprehensive SOC 2 Type II technical controls:

#### Audit Logging System (`server/security-audit.ts`)
- **Security Audit Logs**: Database table tracking all security-relevant events with timestamps, user info, IP addresses, user agents, and request metadata
- **Event Types**: Authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts, password changes), data access/modification events, admin actions, and security alerts
- **Severity Levels**: Info, Warning, Error, Critical - with automatic categorization based on event type

#### Session Security (`server/security-audit.ts`)
- **Security Sessions Table**: Tracks all user sessions with device fingerprinting, browser/OS detection, and geo-location capability
- **Session Management API**: Users can view active sessions (`GET /api/auth/sessions`), revoke specific sessions (`DELETE /api/auth/sessions/:id`), or revoke all other sessions (`POST /api/auth/sessions/revoke-all`)
- **Admin Session Control**: Admins can view user sessions (`GET /api/admin/users/:userId/sessions`) and force logout users (`POST /api/admin/users/:userId/force-logout`)
- **Concurrent Session Limits**: Configurable limits on simultaneous sessions per user

#### Enhanced Security Headers (`server/index.ts`)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict directives for script sources, style sources, connect sources, frame ancestors
- **HSTS**: 1-year max-age with includeSubDomains and preload
- **Additional Headers**: Permissions-Policy, Referrer-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy, Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy
- **API Cache Control**: No-store, no-cache headers for all API responses

#### Rate Limiting (`server/security-audit.ts`)
- **User-Level Rate Limiting**: Database-backed tracking by user ID or IP address
- **Endpoint Categories**: Different limits for auth (5/15min), sensitive (20/min), write (50/min), read (200/min) operations
- **Abuse Detection**: Automatic detection of users/IPs with multiple rate limit violations
- **Rate Limit Headers**: X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset headers on responses

#### Encryption Helpers (`server/security-utils.ts`)
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: `encryptData()` and `decryptData()` for sensitive field encryption
- **Data Masking**: `maskEmail()`, `maskPhoneNumber()`, `maskSensitiveData()` for display purposes
- **Secure Token Generation**: `generateSecureToken()` and `generateSecureOTP()` using crypto.randomBytes

#### Security Dashboard API Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/security/audit-logs` - Query audit logs with filters
- `GET /api/admin/security/stats` - Security statistics summary
- `GET /api/admin/security/recent-alerts` - Recent security alerts
- `GET /api/admin/security/failed-logins` - Failed login analysis by email/IP
- `GET /api/admin/security/active-sessions` - All active sessions across users

### Environment Variables for Production
- `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: 64 hex character (32 byte) key for AES-256-GCM encryption
- `HASH_SALT`: Salt for one-way hashing of sensitive data
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret for session signing (already required)
- `ADMIN_EMAILS`: Comma-separated list of admin email addresses
