# Home Base - Compressed replit.md

## Overview

Home Base is a full-stack web application designed to connect homeowners with specialized contractors, provide a marketplace for DIY products, and offer comprehensive seasonal maintenance guidance. It aims to deliver a sophisticated user experience with an Anthropologie-inspired aesthetic, supporting multi-property management for homeowners and detailed proposal management for contractors to enhance efficiency and organization for both user types.

## System Architecture

### Design and UI/UX
- **Aesthetic**: Modern purple/blue gradient theme with a custom HomeBase logo featuring a house-shaped design with a blue gradient "H" on a purple background. The design is clean, professional, and optimized for a consistent user experience.
- **Components**: Utilizes `shadcn/ui` built on Radix UI for a consistent and sophisticated look.
- **Theming**: Supports light/dark mode with a purple-based color palette (primary: `hsl(260, 65%, 55%)`) for the homeowner interface and a red theme for the contractor interface.
- **Navigation**: Role-based dashboards (Homeowner and Contractor) provide tailored content and quick actions.
- **Sign-in Page**: Features role selection buttons with left-aligned text, consistent padding, and wrapped subcopy for readability.
- **Messages Page**: Includes a collapsible review section, allowing homeowners to leave reviews for contractors while maximizing messaging space.

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Vite is used for development and builds.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, written in TypeScript with ES modules, implementing a RESTful API with JSON responses.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations and Drizzle Kit for schema management.
    - **Persistence**: All critical data, including contractor profiles, project photos, houses, home maintenance data (systems, tasks, logs, service records), conversations, and messages, are persisted in PostgreSQL.
    - **Contractor Search**: Enhanced `searchContractors()` to query the `companies` table, joining with `users` for zip codes, and implementing a two-way radius check for accurate matching.
    - **Messaging**: Conversations and messages are stored in PostgreSQL, ensuring persistence. Automatic notifications are sent for new messages, linking directly to the messages page.
- **Data Flow**: Client requests use TanStack Query, Express routes handle processing, Drizzle ORM accesses PostgreSQL, and responses are JSON, with shared TypeScript types ensuring end-to-end type safety.
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security with Helmet.js, `express-rate-limit`, CORS validation, secure session cookies, SQL injection/XSS pattern detection, and Zod for input validation.
