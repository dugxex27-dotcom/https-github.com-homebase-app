# Home Base - Compressed replit.md

## Overview

Home Base is a full-stack web application designed to connect homeowners with specialized contractors and provide a marketplace for DIY products, alongside comprehensive seasonal maintenance guidance. It aims to offer a sophisticated user experience with an Anthropologie-inspired aesthetic. The platform supports multi-property management for homeowners and detailed proposal management for contractors, enhancing efficiency and organization for both user types.

## System Architecture

### Design and UI/UX
- **Aesthetic**: Modern purple/blue gradient theme with the new HomeBase logo featuring a house-shaped design with blue gradient "H" on purple background. Clean, professional appearance optimized for homeowner experience.
- **Components**: Utilizes shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives for a consistent and sophisticated look.
- **Theming**: Supports light/dark mode with purple-based color palette (primary: hsl(260, 65%, 55%)) for homeowner interface, maintaining red theme for contractor interface.
- **Navigation**: Role-based dashboards (Homeowner and Contractor) serve as primary interfaces, offering tailored content and quick actions.
- **Logo**: Updated to use custom HomeBase logo with house icon and gradient blue "H" design, imported from attached assets.
- **Signin Page**: Role selection buttons feature left-aligned text, consistent padding structure, and properly wrapped subcopy text for optimal readability and visual balance.

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Vite is used for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, written in TypeScript with ES modules. Implements a RESTful API with JSON responses.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, integrated with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations and Drizzle Kit for schema management.
    - **Database Field Mapping**: Manual snake_case ↔ camelCase conversion implemented in `server/storage.ts` for user fields (companyId, companyRole, canRespondToProposals) due to Drizzle ORM automatic casing not working in version 0.39.1
    - Mapping applied in `DbStorage.getUser()` and `DbStorage.getUserByEmail()` to ensure consistency
    - All API endpoints that return user data fetch fresh data via `storage.getUser()` to apply mapping
    - **Photo Persistence Fix**: Contractor profile photos (projectPhotos, businessLogo) are now persisted to the database-backed `companies` table instead of the in-memory `contractors` table via `updateContractorProfile()` calling `updateCompany()`, ensuring photos survive logout/server restarts
    - **House Persistence Fix**: Houses are now stored in PostgreSQL database instead of in-memory storage. Database-backed methods implemented in DbStorage class (`getHouses`, `getHouse`, `createHouse`, `updateHouse`, `deleteHouse`) ensure properties persist across sessions and server restarts
- **Data Flow**: Client requests use TanStack Query, Express routes handle processing, data access is via Drizzle ORM to PostgreSQL, and responses are JSON. Shared TypeScript types ensure end-to-end type safety.
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security with Helmet.js headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options), express-rate-limit for API protection (100 req/15min general, 5 req/15min auth), CORS whitelist validation, secure session cookies (httpOnly, sameSite), SQL injection and XSS pattern detection, and comprehensive input validation via Zod schemas with custom security utilities.

### Key Features and Specifications
- **User Management**: Support for distinct Homeowner and Contractor roles.
- **Authentication System**:
    - Email/password registration with bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
    - Google OAuth integration via Replit Auth for quick signup
        - OAuth callback creates unified session format (req.session.isAuthenticated + req.session.user)
        - Complete-profile flow for OAuth users missing zip code/role
        - Data preservation: existing zipCode and role persist across repeat OAuth logins
        - Requires environment variables: REPLIT_DOMAINS, REPL_ID, ISSUER_URL
    - Zip code capture during registration for geographic analytics
    - Optional invite code system with usage tracking
    - Secure session management with httpOnly cookies
    - Session compatibility: OAuth and email/password use identical session structure
- **Admin Dashboard** (access controlled by ADMIN_EMAILS environment variable):
    - User analytics: total users, homeowner/contractor breakdown
    - Signups by zip code with sortable/filterable table
    - Top search terms across contractor directory and marketplace
    - Recent searches timeline with context (contractor/marketplace)
    - Invite code management: create, view usage stats, deactivate codes
- **Search Analytics**:
    - Automatic tracking of all contractor directory searches
    - Automatic tracking of all marketplace product searches
    - Captures: search term, service type, user zip code, timestamp, context
    - Powers admin dashboard insights and geographic trends
- **Company-Based Contractor Architecture** (IN PROGRESS):
    - **All contractors must belong to a company** - No individual contractor accounts
    - **Company Ownership Model**:
        - Owner creates company during registration and manages team
        - Employees join via invite code generated by owner
        - Owner has full control: edit company profile, generate invites, remove employees
        - **Proposal Management**: Only owners can respond to proposals by default; owner can toggle permission for employees if it's in their job description
        - Employees can create service records for completed jobs
    - **Multi-User Support**: Multiple employees from same company can work simultaneously on different devices
    - **Company Management API**:
        - POST /api/companies - Create company (owner only)
        - GET /api/companies/:id - Get company details
        - PUT /api/companies/:id - Update company profile (owner only)
        - GET /api/companies/:id/employees - View team members
        - DELETE /api/companies/:id/employees/:userId - Remove employee
        - POST /api/companies/:id/invite-codes - Generate invite code
        - GET /api/companies/invite-codes/:code - Validate invite code
    - **Database Schema**:
        - `companies` table: name, bio, services, contact info, licenses, ratings
        - `company_invite_codes` table: invite code management with expiration
        - `users.companyId` and `users.companyRole` (owner/employee)
        - Service records, proposals, and reviews reference companyId + employeeId
    - Address autocomplete with OpenStreetMap Nominatim supporting international addresses

        - House selection dropdown on each page allows switching between properties
        - Backend enforces house ownership verification for security
        - Server-side filtering reduces payload size and improves performance
